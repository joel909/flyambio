##Day 1 (1-4 Hours)
Today I wanted to build something for highway so I went up and got a few ideas and I found out about building drones and it stuck a chord 
and i decided to make one later on during my reasearch on drones I felt I wanted to do something unique and I started my work with RC planes what made it cool would be that it would fly about 300Km/h Cuz i came across this really cool videa on yt. SO since I knew nothing I went deep dived into the topic and leared a few basics about this stuff wated tutorials and got a basic understanding about different kinds of mortor foams trasmitter battries and all sorts of stuff like that, I also started doing research about the design of the plane on how it would be designed and stuff i wanted a few vids and say a standard design which would have a propeller on the front and a wings and a flaps on those to move around and stuff also I got an intro about Airfoils and started tikering with it like on the site airfoiltools site.

##Day 2 (4-7 hours)
I went and started learning about airfolis continuation from the last day I did a lot of study about how different airfoils impact the lift the speed and stuff like if u have a bigger cross section u can have lift but the drag is higher so it cant travel that fast but if its too thin it wont even fly lol, and i did all that after that i ran a few text based simulation i also spent some time working on understanding how to simulate and understand its readings so basicallly I took into account the frontal area the surface area and stuff and did some calculations to find a kida decent structure like i found out that mh43 from airfoiltools is the best for my use case also with 33% think neess not 100%
